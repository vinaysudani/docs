## Configuring the data source
Grafana requires a configured data source before building dashboards. To configure the WideSky data source:
1. Open the side menu by clicking the Grafana icon in the top header.
2. In the side menu under the Dashboards link you should find a link named Data Sources.
3. Click the + Add data source button in the top header.
4. Select WideSky from the Type drop-down menu.
5. Complete the fields in the following table.

{{% alert title="Note"  color="info" %}} If you do not see the Data Sources link in your side menu it means that your current user does not have the Admin role for the current Grafana organization.
{{% /alert %}}

### Access Mode

Access mode controls how requests to the data source are handled by the browser.

### Server access mode (Default)

All requests are made from the browser to Grafana backend/server which in turn forwards the requests to the data source and by that circumvent possible Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements.

### Browser access mode
All requests are made from the browser directly to the data source and may be subject to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements. The URL needs to be accessible from the browser if you select this access mode.
