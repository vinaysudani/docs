  `load`: Make changes to the asset model in WideSky.
---

`widesky-editor load` is a wrapper around the [`read`](../../../apis/cloud/rest/ops/read), [`create`](../../../apis/cloud/rest/ops/create), [`update`](../../../apis/cloud/rest/ops/update) and [`delete`](../../../apis/cloud/rest/ops/delete) API end-points.  The input file can be either created from scratch, or generated by the [`dump`](../dump) command.

## Usage reference

```bash
widesky-editor [-h] [--quiet] [--debug] [--log LOG] [--http-debug]
               [--uri URI] [--tls-verify TLS_VERIFY]
               [--username USERNAME] [--password PASSWORD]
               [--client-id CLIENT_ID] [--client-secret CLIENT_SECRET]
               [--impersonate-as IMPERSONATE] [--output OUTPUT]
               [--yaml] [--csv]
	       load [-h] [--csv-in] filename [filename ...]
```

* `--csv-in`: Input files are in CSV format
* `filename`: File names to load instructions from

The files are processed as if logically concatenated together.  If `--csv-in` is specified, then the input files are expected to be in [CSV](../../../fileformats/widesky-editor/csv) format, otherwise [YAML](../../../fileformats/widesky-editor/yaml) format is assumed.

The `--output` argument generates a report of what has been changed in the asset model which can be used by other tools.  `--csv` has no effect.
